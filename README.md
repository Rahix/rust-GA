# rust-GA #

## A genetic algorithm implemented in rust ##
This is a simple genetic algorithm, nothin special, just for learning purposes and because it is fantastic to watch a ga getting closer and
closer to it's result.

## How does is work? ##
A genetic algorithm tries to simulate a population of individuums which behave the way Darwin discovered the evolution to behave:

* Individuums with a bad fitness die first
* -> Individuums with a better fitness are more likely to survive
* Sometimes random mutations happen in the genetic informations.

This program doesn't have a very complex fitness function, in fact it is so simple that a genetic algorithm is not needed at all.
But it is still pretty cool to watch the population forming a line pattern.
